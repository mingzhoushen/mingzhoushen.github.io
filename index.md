Welcome to my website!

I am an applied microeconomist and Ph.D. candidate at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) and a member of the [PCHES](https://www.pches.psu.edu/). My current research focuses on issues of natural disaster risk management and climate adaptation. I have studied the impacts of drought-induced building moratoria on housing market in California. My ongoing work develops a household location choice model to assess how water scarcity affects housing prices and thus household migration in the Western U.S. By employing advanced techniques such as causal inference and discrete choice modeling, I aim to produce actionable insights that promote sustainability and socioeconomic equity. I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Karen Fisher-Vanden](https://aese.psu.edu/directory/kaf26) (advisor), [Douglas H. Wrenn](https://aese.psu.edu/directory/dhw121), [Qin Fan](https://craig.fresnostate.edu/about/directory/econ/fan-qin.html), [Emily Pakhtigian](https://publicpolicy.psu.edu/faculty-and-research/people/emily-pakhtigian/), [Heather Preisendanz](https://abe.psu.edu/directory/heg12), and [Alfonso Mejia](https://www.cee.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=aim127).

Prior to beginning my Ph.D. in 2020, I worked with the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/home/en) in Rome, Italy. I hold both a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China.  

I am currently on the job market for the 2024-2025 academic year and available for interviews.
