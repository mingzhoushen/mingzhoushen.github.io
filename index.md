Welcome to my website!

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at the [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). My research focuses on environmental economics and applied econometrics. I am advised by Professors [Karen Fisher-Vanden](https://aese.psu.edu/directory/kaf26) (chair), [Douglas H. Wrenn](https://aese.psu.edu/directory/dhw121), [Qin Fan](https://craig.fresnostate.edu/about/directory/econ/fan-qin.html), [Emily Pakhtigian](https://publicpolicy.psu.edu/faculty-and-research/people/emily-pakhtigian/), [Heather Preisendanz](https://abe.psu.edu/directory/heg12), and [Alfonso Mejia](https://www.cee.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=aim127).

Before moving to the United States for my Ph.D. in 2020, I worked with the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/home/en) in Rome, Italy, as a Research Analyst. I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China.
