Welcome to my website!

I am an Economist with a Ph.D. in Energy, Environmental, and Food Economics from [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). My research focuses on natural disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. I have examined how drought-induced building moratoria shape Californiaâ€™s housing market, and my job market paper investigates how water scarcity affects household location choices and welfare. Broadly, my work aims to generate insights that advance sustainability and social equity.

I obtained both my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China.  

I will be joining the School of Public Affairs at Zhejiang University as an Assistant Professor.
