Welcome to my website!

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Economics at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). My research focuses primarily on how environmental risks and policies affect labor and housing markets, using causal inference and discrete choice modeling approaches. I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Karen Fisher-Vanden](https://aese.psu.edu/directory/kaf26) (chair), [Douglas H. Wrenn](https://aese.psu.edu/directory/dhw121), [Qin Fan](https://craig.fresnostate.edu/about/directory/econ/fan-qin.html), [Emily Pakhtigian](https://publicpolicy.psu.edu/faculty-and-research/people/emily-pakhtigian/), [Heather Preisendanz](https://abe.psu.edu/directory/heg12), and [Alfonso Mejia](https://www.cee.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=aim127).

Before starting my Ph.D. in 2020, I worked as an intern with the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/home/en) in Rome, Italy. I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Civil Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China.  

I am currently on the job market for the 2024-2025 academic year and available for interviews.
