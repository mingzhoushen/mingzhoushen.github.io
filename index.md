Welcome to my website!

I am an economist with a Ph.D. in Applied Economics from [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). My research focuses on natural disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. I have studied how drought-induced building moratoria shape Californiaâ€™s housing market, and my job market paper investigates how water scarcity affects household location choices and welfare. My broader goal is to generate policy-relevant insights that promote sustainability, resilience, and social equity.

I am fortunate to be advised by Professors Karen Fisher-Vanden, Douglas H. Wrenn, and Qin Fan.

I received both my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China.  

I will be joining the School of Public Affairs at Zhejiang University as an Assistant Professor.
