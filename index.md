Welcome to my website!

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at the Pennsylvania State University. My research focuses on environmental economics and applied econometrics. I am advised by Professors Karen Fisher-Vanden (chair), Douglas H. Wrenn, Qin Fan, Emily Pakhtigian, Heather Preisendanz, and Alfonso Mejia.

Before moving to the United States for my Ph.D. in 2020, I worked with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome, Italy, as a Research Analyst. I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Zhejiang University, China.
