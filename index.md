Welcome to my website!

I am an applied microeconomist and Ph.D. candidate at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). As a member of [PCHES](https://www.pches.psu.edu/), my research focuses on natural disaster risk management and climate adaptation. I have studied the impacts of drought-induced building moratoria on California's housing market, and my ongoing work develops a household location choice model to assess how water scarcity influences housing prices and household migration. By employing advanced techniques such as causal inference and discrete choice modeling, I aim to produce actionable insights that promote sustainability and socioeconomic equity. I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Karen Fisher-Vanden](https://aese.psu.edu/directory/kaf26) (advisor), [Douglas H. Wrenn](https://aese.psu.edu/directory/dhw121), [Qin Fan](https://craig.fresnostate.edu/about/directory/econ/fan-qin.html), and [Emily Pakhtigian](https://publicpolicy.psu.edu/faculty-and-research/people/emily-pakhtigian/).

Prior to beginning my Ph.D. in 2020, I worked with the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/home/en) in Rome, Italy. I hold both a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China.  

I am currently on the job market for the 2024-2025 academic year and available for interviews.
