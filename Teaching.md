**Mathematics**  
In the summer of 2013, I taught mathematics to middle school students at Chunâ€™an Middle School in China. Using public transportation schedules as case studies, I helped students calculate distances and travel times, making linear equations tangible through practical, relatable examples. This experience sparked my passion for teaching.
