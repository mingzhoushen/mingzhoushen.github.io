### Abstract
Intensifying droughts pose significant challenges for California's water resources. This study investigates the impacts of droughts on household location choices and housing supply across Californian counties. Results reveal heterogeneous responses to drought conditions, with certain demographics (elderly, college graduates, households with children, Black and Asian populations) being more averse. The average housing supply elasticity is estimated at 1.072, with populous and coastal counties exhibiting the most inelastic supply. Land availability strongly influences housing supply and prices, particularly in populous counties, while water-related building moratoriums have no significant effect. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in developing drought-related policies and adaptive strategies.
