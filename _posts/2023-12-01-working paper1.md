## Abstract
California is facing a housing affordability crisis which has been partially blamed on building moratoria  
enacted to address the stateâ€™s severe water shortages. This study uses data on the enactment of moratoria in   
California from 2010 to 2018 to examine their impact on new housing supply and prices. We find that the   
short-run impact of the moratoria is small, but that the effect grows with time with the long-run lagged   
impact resulting in a significant reduction in housing supply especially for locally mandated moratoria. We do   
not, however, find that these supply shocks have had an impact on housing prices.
