### Abstract
Water scarcity has intensified across the western United States in recent decades, driven by natural aridity, rapid population growth, and a system of water rights and infrastructure that often fails to allocate water based on scarcity or willingness to pay. These factors have increased shortages and unmet demand for many cities and municipalities. We hypothesize that rising unmet demand affects household utility, rents, and residential location choices. To test this, we combine a Rosen-Roback spatial equilibrium model with a hydrologic model that incorporates both natural and legal water availability across the region from 2000 to 2020. Our findings show that household sorting responds to changes in annual unmet water demand, with households willing to pay $19 (0.03% of income) to avoid an additional day of unmet demand per year. Based on average daily consumption, this equates to $0.027 per gallon—2.5 to 5.4 times larger than previous estimates based on partial equilibrium demand analysis—highlighting the importance of moving costs and sorting in shaping welfare impacts of water scarcity.
