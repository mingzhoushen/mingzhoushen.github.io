### Abstract
The Western U.S. confronts a striking paradox: surging population growth amid intensifying droughts, leading to a severe water crisis. This paper employs a spatial equilibrium model to examine how households adjust their location choices in response to drought-induced water shortages from 2000 to 2020, and the resulting welfare effects. A key contribution is the use of novel unmet water demand data that uniquely integrates the legal framework of water rights with actual water availability. The results demonstrate that households require substantial compensation to relocate to water-scarce regions. Specifically, they demand a 0.06% wage premium to accept an additional cubic meter of annual unmet water demand. This compensation requirement is notably higher among households over 40 and homeowners. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the welfare impact is primarily driven by the direct disutility of water scarcity rather than by rent shocks. These insights offer valuable guidance for developing equitable and effective climate adaptation policies.
