### Abstract
The Western U.S. faces a paradoxical challenge: rapid population growth amidst increasingly severe droughts, leading to a severe water crisis. This study employs a residential sorting model to analyze household location decisions and the associated welfare implications in response to drought risk from 2000 to 2020. A key innovation is the use of novel unmet water demand data that integrates the legal dimension of water allocation—water rights—with water availability for the first time. The findings reveal that households require significant compensation to move to areas with greater water scarcity. On average, they expect a 0.06% increase in annual wages to tolerate an additional cubic meter of unmet water demand, with households over 40 and homeowners demanding even higher compensation. The welfare impact is primarily driven by the direct disutility of water shortages rather than by housing cost shocks. These insights can inform policies addressing adaptation and equity concerns in the face of climate change. [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive)
