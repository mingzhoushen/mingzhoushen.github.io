### Abstract
While the mandatory labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is required for many food products, it is not currently enforced in the alcohol beverage industry. Despite this, some wine producers voluntarily label their products as non-GMO to differentiate their offerings. This study investigates the signaling effect of non-GMO labels on consumer demand for wine. An online choice experiment with 1,306 participants was conducted to examine how the presence of non-GMO labels influences consumer preferences. The findings indicate that the introduction of non-GMO labels leads to a stigmatization of unlabeled wines, resulting in a significant decrease in demand for these products. However, when consumers were presented with all three labeling options (no label, non-GMO, and GMO), the stigma effect was no longer significant. These results have important implications for the ongoing debate surrounding the implementation of mandatory GMO labeling in the alcohol beverage sector by the U.S. Federal Government. The findings suggest that if mandatory GMO labeling were to be enacted, consumers might not differentiate between unlabeled and non-GMO labeled products.
