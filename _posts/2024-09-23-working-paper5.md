### Abstract
Over the past three decades, cities and municipalities across the Western U.S. have experienced some of the nationâ€™s fastest population growth. Simultaneously, these regions have confronted increasingly frequent water shortages, primarily caused by droughts. This study employs a spatial equilibrium model to examine how water shortages have influenced household location decisions from 2000 to 2020 as well as the resulting welfare implications. The contributions of this research are twofold. First, the study leverages novel unmet water demand data that integrates the legal framework of water rights with actual water availability to better quantify water shortages. Second, the model reflects both the direct utility effect and indirect rent impact of water shortages on household decisions. The results indicate that households require substantial compensation to relocate to water-scarce regions, demanding a 0.06% wage premium for each additional cubic meter of unmet annual water demand annually. This compensation demand is notably higher among households over 40 as well as homeowners. Lastly, the analysis reveals that the welfare impact is driven primarily by the direct disutility of water shortages rather than by indirect rent shocks. These findings underscore the significant role of water scarcity in shaping population growth patterns across the Western U.S. [[link]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ZeN-Q4jeB4Cqs3pwVcZ4b7XAuPUwWOb/view?usp=drive_link)
