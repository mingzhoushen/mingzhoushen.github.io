### Abstract
This paper examines the impact of drought on land-use regulations, using data from the Wharton survey as the primary source. I classify the survey's subindexes into two categories: Known knowns and known unknowns. Known knowns refer to explicit costs, such as impact fees, which are transparent and predictable. In contrast, known unknowns represent factors that are acknowledged but whose specific nature or magnitude remains uncertain. In this context, drought-induced regulations fall into the latter category; while the occurrence of drought is evident, its precise influence on land-use policies is difficult to quantify. I apply principal component analysis to consolidate the subindexes classified as known unknowns into an aggregated index, which serves as a proxy for exploring the effect of drought on land-use regulations.


using the Wharton Index as the primary data source. I categorize its subindexes into two groups: known knowns and known unknowns. Known knowns refer to explicit costs, such as impact fees, which are transparent and predictable. In contrast, known unknowns represent factors whose presence is acknowledged but whose specific nature or magnitude remains uncertain. In this context, drought-induced regulations fall into the latter category; while the occurrence of drought is clear, its exact influence on land-use policies is challenging to quantify. To address this, I use principal component analysis to consolidate the subindexes classified as known unknowns into an aggregated index, which serves as a proxy for exploring the impact of drought on land-use regulations.
