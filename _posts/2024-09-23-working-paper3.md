### Abstract
In 2022, the California State Water Board implemented a statewide ban on lawn watering. This study investigates the effectiveness of the lawn watering moratorium in conserving water and examines the extent of non-compliance by residents. I utilize a newly developed remotely sensed soil moisture database to analyze soil moisture levels before and after the implementation of watering restrictions, focusing on variations along district boundaries. Additionally, I employ a maximum entropy approach to assess lawn greenness during the restriction periods, which helps infer potential violations. By comparing water usage and soil moisture patterns relative to the moratorium, I aim to quantify the water savings achieved and identify areas of significant non-compliance. The findings from this study will provide valuable insights for water management authorities and policymakers to optimize future water conservation strategies and enforcement efforts.
