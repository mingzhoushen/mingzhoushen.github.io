### Abstract
In 2022, the California State Water Board implemented a statewide ban on lawn watering to address water conservation concerns. This study investigates the effectiveness of the lawn watering moratorium by analyzing changes in soil moisture levels and assessing the extent of non-compliance by residents. Utilizing a newly developed remotely sensed soil moisture database, I compare moisture levels before and after the implementation of watering restrictions. Additionally, I pay attention to variations across water district boundaries, as some districts had imposed the ban prior to 2022. As a robustness check, I also employ a maximum entropy approach to evaluate lawn greenness during the restriction periods. This study aims to quantify the water savings achieved and identify areas of significant non-compliance. The findings will offer valuable insights for water management authorities and policymakers to optimize future water conservation strategies and enforcement efforts.
