### Abstract
The increasing frequency and severity of droughts in California have necessitated aggressive water conservation measures. In 2022, the California State Water Board enacted an unprecedented statewide ban on lawn watering, marking a significant shift in residential water management policy. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of this policy's effectiveness by leveraging novel remote sensing technology and employing rigorous econometric methods to measure compliance and water conservation outcomes.

The research utilizes the newly available SMAP L1A Radar Time-Ordered Parsed Telemetry database (Version 1), which provides high-resolution soil moisture measurements at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales. This dataset enables the precise tracking of soil moisture levels before and after the implementation of watering restrictions, offering insights into actual water usage patterns that were previously unobservable through traditional monitoring methods.

The analytical framework employs a difference-in-differences approach, exploiting the variation in implementation timing across water districts. This quasi-experimental setting allows for the identification of causal effects while controlling for confounding factors such as weather patterns and seasonal variations. To strengthen the analysis, the study incorporates a novel maximum entropy approach to evaluate lawn greenness as a complementary measure of compliance. By combining satellite imagery analysis with machine learning techniques, this method provides an independent verification of water usage patterns and helps identify potential areas of non-compliance. The dual measurement approach – tracking both soil moisture and vegetation health – provides a more robust assessment of policy effectiveness than either metric alone.

Preliminary results indicate significant heterogeneity in compliance across regions and socioeconomic groups. Areas with historically higher water consumption show greater absolute reductions in soil moisture levels, suggesting the policy has been most effective in targeting high-usage households. However, non-compliance clusters appear in certain neighborhoods, particularly in affluent areas where the monetary penalties may be insufficient deterrents.

The study's findings have immediate policy implications for water management authorities. By quantifying the actual water savings achieved and mapping compliance patterns, this research provides actionable insights for optimizing enforcement strategies and designing more effective conservation policies. The methodology developed here also offers a replicable framework for evaluating similar policies in other drought-prone regions.
