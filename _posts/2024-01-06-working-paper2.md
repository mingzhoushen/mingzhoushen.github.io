## Abstract
Droughts are among the most devastating natural disasters, inflicting costs that average over $9.5 billion annually   
in the U.S. alone. Beyond their significant economic impact, droughts have a dire human cost. They are responsible  
for the second-highest number of deaths among natural disasters, claiming over 3,000 lives since 1980 (NCEI, 2023).  This impact is particularly pronounced in the Western U.S., where the period from 2000 to 2021 marked the driest  22 years span in the last 1,200 years (Williams et al., Nature Climate Change, 2022). Intensified by climate change,  droughts are not just becoming more frequent; they are also increasing in both duration and intensity, leading to  billion-dollar drought events nearly every year (McNabb et al., Springer Nature, 2023). Despite this, the adaptive  strategies of households, particularly their migration responses to severe droughts, are not well understood.  Investigating these adaptive behaviors is crucial, as they not only shape local economic dynamics, such as labor  and housing markets, but also inform necessary policy measures needed to support the most vulnerable individuals,  households, and communities.

In our study, we conduct a spatial equilibrium analysis of the effects of severe droughts on household location choices 
cross 83 counties in the Western United States, spanning the years from 2000 to 2019. Innovatively, our approach incorporates a housing supply equation into the spatial equilibrium model. Contrary to prior sorting models that  primarily characterize housing demand and treat the supply as fixed, our integration enables the model to more  accurately capture the dynamics of the housing market in response to population migration. As a result, this  enhanced model offers deeper insights into the impact of severe droughts on both labor and housing markets, framed within a general equilibrium context.
