### Abstract
As climate change accelerates, the Western U.S. is projected to experience an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme droughts. This looming crisis underscores the need to better understand potential adaptive responses from households. In this study, we employ a spatial equilibrium framework to examine the influence of drought-induced water shortage on household location choice across the Western U.S. Our findings are multifaceted: First, households experience reduced utility when residing outside their birth state, with significant preference heterogeneity regarding relocation. Second, water shortage impacts household location choice by reducing utility and raising rents, prompting households to move to locations where higher incomes offset these risks. Third, households are willing to pay $0.18 to avoid an additional gallon of unmet water demand. Lastly, counties experiencing water shortage have a more inelastic housing supply. Our study highlights the critical role of water scarcity in shaping population distribution and economic behaviors in the Western U.S.
