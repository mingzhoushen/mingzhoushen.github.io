### Abstract
As climate change accelerates, the Western U.S. is expected to experience more frequent and severe droughts. This looming crisis underscores the need to understand how households may adapt. In this study, Mingzhou applies a residential sorting model to examine how drought-induced water shortages influence household location choices in the region. His findings are multifaceted: First, households experience significant disutility from living outside their birth states, with preference varying by demographics. Second, water shortages influence household location decisions by both lowering utility and raising rents. This prompts households to relocate to areas where higher net incomes and other desirable amenities can offset these adverse effects.  Third, households are willing to pay $0.12 to avoid an additional gallon of unmet water demand annually, with elderly households and homeowners willing to pay more. His study emphasizes the crucial role of megadroughts in shaping population distribution in the Western U.S.
