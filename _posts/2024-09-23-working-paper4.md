### Abstract
Water scarcity has become a defining constraint on growth in the western United States, with the Colorado River Basin at the center of this challenge. Supplying water to over 40 million people, the Basin faces persistent shortages driven by over-allocation and environmental change-induced declines in flow. This paper provides the first system-wide evidence on how scarcity shapes housing markets, introducing a novel measure of unmet water demand that integrates hydrologic conditions with water rights. Using panel data on housing construction and transactions from 2010–2020, we estimate binned fixed effects models to capture nonlinear responses. Results show that new homebuilding falls once shortages exceed 30 days, with prolonged scarcity nearly halting construction in the Lower Basin, while the Upper Basin displays more volatile responses. Housing prices decline by 3–5 percent under sustained scarcity, indicating that buyer aversion outweighs supply constraints.
