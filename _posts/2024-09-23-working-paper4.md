### Abstract
Cities and municipalities across the Western U.S. have experienced some of the fastest population growth in the country over the past 30 years. Simultaneously, this region has been frequently impacted by droughts, a trend that is projected to persist in the future as climate change accelerates (Zhang et al. 2021; Dannenberg et al. 2022; Yuan et al. 2023). This combination of rapid population growth and extreme droughts has placed significant strain on water supplies, leading to shortages in many municipalities.

While the total annual amount of water available within a given location is a function of hydrologic conditions, the actual amount supplied to specific sectors of the economy in the Western U.S. – i.e., domestic, agriculture, and industry – is determined both by natural conditions as well as the legal distributions laid out in the prior appropriations structure governing many areas. The prior appropriations doctrine is a legal structure that determines water allocations across economic sectors and is based on the chronological order in which users first established beneficial use to it. In times of scarcity, senior water rights holders receive their full allocation, while junior holders – those with claims established later in time – are vulnerable to shortages.

In this paper, we employ a spatial regression discontinuity (RD) model to analyze the impact of water scarcity on housing supply in the Western U.S. State and local water institutions across the region have implemented water-related building moratoria to restrict new construction and conserve water resources (Shen et al. 2024). In addition to these direct restrictions, states like California and Arizona have regulations requiring developers to secure guaranteed water supplies – 20 years in California and 100 years in Arizona – before obtaining building permits. These requirements create additional hurdles for new housing development, especially as water scarcity becomes more severe.

This paper contributes to the literature by introducing a novel metric, unmet water demand (UWD), which integrates both physical water availability and legal water rights in resource allocation. Previous studies examining the impact of water scarcity on housing development have largely relied on hydrologic conditions, often overlooking the critical role of water rights. By accounting for both physical and legal constraints, the UWD metric provides a more accurate measure of water stress at each location. Furthermore, while several studies have explored the impact of water scarcity on housing development in specific regions (Fox et al. 2001; Parsons et al. 2014), to our knowledge, no study has examined the entire American West over an extended period from 2000 to 2020. This type of comprehensive analysis is essential for understanding how water scarcity has been reshaping the region’s housing market dynamics.
